WIRELESS DEVELOPMENT BOARD DESIGN

TENET is development board specifically designed for beginners and enthusiasts in the field of IoT and Robotics. At the heart of the board is the NINA-B302 microcontroller unit. The board also features the ESP-12F wireless chip for wireless connectivity. Incase if you're wondering how is it any different from other boards out there, then have a closer look at the design. TENET has an inbuilt DRV8833 motordriver which can be used to connect upto 2 motors without the need for any external shields. The board also has a Li-Po charging unit that can be used to power the board using a single cell Li-Po battery, which will come in handy while prototyping your next wireless robot.

The board also has quite a few sensors that you might need for your integrated Iot project. The details of all the features of the board are provided below:

1) 16 GPIO Headers
2) LSM9DS1-iNEMO Inertial Module
3) DRV8833 dual-H Bridge Motor Driver
4) LPS25HB Pressure Sensor
5) APDS-9960 Digital Proximity, Ambient Light, RGB and Gesture Sensor
6) HTS221 Capacitive digital sensor for relative humidity and temperature
7) ESP-12F WiFi Module
